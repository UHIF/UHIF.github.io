Hi, I‚Äôm Siyuan Zhang, a PhD candidate at Jiangnan University, advised by Prof. [Linbo Xie](https://iot.jiangnan.edu.cn/info/1141/3536.htm). My research focuses on the machine learning, trusty deep learning and model calibration.

I‚Äôm a challenger of Teamfight Tactics in S2, S4, S6, S7, and S9. I‚Äôm also an Emerald rank player in League of Legends and a skilled Guandan player. I‚Äôve been being a fan of Wang Leehom for 15 years. I drive an Avatr12. I believe the Cleveland Cavaliers will win the NBA Championship this season.

**I am currently looking for employment opportunities.**
